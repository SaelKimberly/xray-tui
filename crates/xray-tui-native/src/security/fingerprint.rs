//! Fingerprint parsing + verifier building for the `xray-tui-tls` engine.
//!
//! `wrap()` routes every TLS connect through the engine
//! (`xray_tui_tls::client::connect`); this module supplies the engine-side
//! pieces: the URL `fp` id parser, the id → [`Fingerprint`] identity mapping, and
//! the [`WebPkiVerifier`] builder — harness CA (test/e2e), `webpki-roots`
//! (production), `allowInsecure`, or a `pinSHA256` SPKI pin.
