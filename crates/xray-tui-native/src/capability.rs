//! Native-capability predicate: which protocol+config rows the in-process
//! core may serve (spec brief §2).
//!
//! [`kind_supported`] is the cheap kind-only gate (display/sort paths that
//! cannot load the full config); [`support_reason`] is the config-aware
//! runtime gate (connect/ping paths) and [`supported`] its bool form, so the
//! reason it returns doubles as the user-visible `[real]` marker text. A row
//! native serves *worse* than a subprocess is refused so Auto resolution falls
//! back to the subprocess. VLESS `mlkem768x25519plus` account encryption was
//! such a row until 2026-09-23; it is now supported and gated on the connect
//! path's own parser (`mlkem_encryption_supported`), which refuses only a
//! value that is not that scheme or that the codec would reject at dial time.
//!
//! The predicate mirrors the native dispatch arms, not xray's feature set:
//! [`crate::protocol`], [`crate::transport`], and [`crate::security`]. A
//! combo both cores reject (equal-failure) stays `true` per brief D5; only
//! native-worse/deferred markers return `false`.
//!
//! Unknown values fail CLOSED. A row carrying a field native cannot parse (an
//! mKCP seed, an unimplemented transport) returns `false`: a false positive is
//! a connection that dies (or worse, hangs) where the subprocess would have
//! worked, while a false negative costs only the in-process fast path.
//!
//! A TLS fingerprint id is **no longer a refusal**: an id with no roster row is
//! probed with the engine default and marked approximated
//! (`security::fingerprint::resolve_fingerprint`, read by `security::wrap`
//! where the substitution happens), so this gate does not consult one.
