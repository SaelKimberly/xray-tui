//! SIP003 plugin framing: the `transport/v2ray` layer (spec §5 items 1–2).
//!
//! A plugin row's wire is `TCP → [TLS] → plugin framing → [mux] → SS codec`, and
//! the obfs modes here are **stream transformers**, not transports: they rewrite
//! the first bytes and then pass everything through. The v2ray-plugin modes
//! (websocket) arrive in `ws.rs`. `mode=quic` would replace the dial entirely,
//! so it has NO arm in this layer — and none is promised: it is refused at
//! `capability` before any dial, because its client wire could not be pinned
//! from evidence. `protocol::connect_quic` is NOT the plugin's arm (it covers
//! Hysteria2/1/TUIC). See the T22 evidence note in
//! `docs/aegis/plans/2026-09-30-ss-plugin.md` before adding one.
//!
//! This layer is **framing only**: it never applies TLS and never produces the
//! mux multiplexer (`transport::upgrade` returns a `BoxStream`, and a
//! multiplexer is not a byte stream). TLS is the chain's security phase —
//! outermost, matching both references (v2ray-core's websocket dialer wraps the
//! raw dialer in `securityEngine.Client` and upgrades over that; sing-box wraps
//! the dialer with `tls.NewDialer` and then upgrades).
//!
//! References: `thirdparty/sing-box/transport/simple-obfs/{http,tls}.go` (the
//! exact bytes), `thirdparty/sing-box/transport/sip003/` (the option
//! vocabulary), `common/mux/server.go` (why mux is the plugin's business).

/// **There is deliberately no quic arm here, and none is promised.** The wire

/// mutually incompatible QUIC wires are — so `mode=quic` is REFUSED at
/// `capability::QUIC_WIRE_UNPINNED` before any dial, and this catch-all is
/// unreachable for it. `protocol::connect_quic` covers Hysteria2/1/TUIC only and
/// is NOT the plugin's arm; do not read this note as an invitation to add one
/// without first closing that evidence gap (the plan's T22 note).
