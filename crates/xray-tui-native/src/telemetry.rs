//! Native-core telemetry: log / traffic / per-connection trace events.
//!
//! TWO cheap, async-friendly feeds for the TUI adapter: log lines on one
//! bounded [`tokio::sync::mpsc`] channel, per-connection trace rows on their
//! own. The split is the point — every emit is a non-blocking `try_send`, so
//! a full channel drops the event, and a log burst sharing one queue would
//! evict the `Opened`/`Closed` pair of a live connection (leaving the TUI's
//! connection table holding a leg that already ended). [`NativeEvents::recv`]
//! drains traces first for the same reason.
//!
//! A drop is COUNTED, never logged inline: a `tracing::warn!` from here
//! re-enters the TUI's log layer, which emits another log event, which drops
//! again. The counts surface as one summary line per poll window, folded in
//! by [`Telemetry::drain_traffic`].
//!
//! Byte totals accumulate in shared atomics that the 3 s delta poller reads
//! with [`Telemetry::drain_traffic`].
//!
//! Connection ids come from a process-global [`AtomicU64`] counter and are
//! assigned inside [`Telemetry::opened`], which returns the fresh id for the
//! later [`Telemetry::closed`] call. [`TraceGuard`] ties the two together so
//! a cancelled relay still reports its close row. Byte accounting rides on
//! [`Counted`], a thin `AsyncRead`/`AsyncWrite` wrapper (writes count as up,
//! reads as down) sharing the telemetry atomics; create one per relayed
//! stream with [`Telemetry::counted`].
