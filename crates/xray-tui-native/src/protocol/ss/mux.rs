//! The Shadowsocks arm of the v2ray-plugin mux: a [`MuxClient`] whose
//! sessions each carry their **own** Shadowsocks codec.
//!
//! The layering is the reason this is not `MuxClient<BoxStream>` like the
//! VLESS arm. VLESS's codec sits *under* the multiplexer, so its sessions are
//! framed by the time they leave the mux. Here the plugin framing is the
//! stream and the SS codec sits **above** each session — and it must, because
//! one salt/subkey/counter stream is exactly one SS connection
//! (`ss/stream.rs`: *"a salt/counter is never carried across"*). A single
//! codec wrapped around the whole tunnel would push two connections' bytes
//! through one counter stream, which the server's per-connection subkey
//! rejects, and it would also break the chunk framing.
//!
//! So: [`SsMux::open_session`] opens a mux session and runs that session's own
//! handshake against the **session's** destination — which is not
//! `ctx.target`, because a v2ray-plugin New frame carries a dummy address
//! (spec §7), so the codec entry takes the target explicitly
//! ([`stream::connect_to`] / [`stream2022::connect_to`]).
//!
//! Tunnel granularity: one tunnel per dial carrying one session (spec §5.2).
//! The server builds a `ServerWorker` per inbound stream
//! (`common/mux/server.go`), so a fresh tunnel per dial is correct and
//! stateless; a *pooled* tunnel is the change that would make multiplexing
//! pay off, and it is not this one.
