//! Trojan — native client.
//!
//! Wire contract: xray-core / sing-box `proxy/trojan` (MIT; sing-box
//! `transport/trojan/protocol.go`). The client writes the request header
//! `hex(sha224(password)) (56 ASCII bytes) || CRLF || command || address ||
//! CRLF` where the address is **port-last** (`ATYP | addr | port BE2` —
//! trojan's `NewAddressParser` has no `PortFirst()` option, and sing-box's
//! `SocksaddrSerializer` is port-last too), command `1` = TCP / `3` = UDP.
//! There is **no server response header**: after the request the server
//! relays the target's bytes raw in both directions (xray `server.go`
//! `handleConnection` and `<sing>/protocol/trojan/client.go` both relay
//! without a response frame). The tunnel is pure passthrough.
//!
//! The trojan address uses the SOCKS5-ATYP family bytes (`0x01` IPv4 /
//! `0x03` domain / `0x04` IPv6) in port-last order —
//! [`crate::addr::encode_addr_port_last`] — NOT the VLESS/VMess
//! `ADDR_TYPE_*` (1/2/3) set, which those protocols' parsers expect.
