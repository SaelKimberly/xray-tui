//! The purge policy: which probe evidence moves a config to Purgatory.
//!
//! This module is the ONLY owner of that decision (spec
//! `2026-09-17-purge-reason-design.md` §6/§7). The engine reports typed
//! evidence ([`FailureEvidence`]) where the failure happened; the taxonomy —
//! which classes count, and which are plausibly transient — is product policy
//! and lives here, in one function, so a revision costs one function rather
//! than a schema change.

/// The verdict a failed real probe's evidence earns, or `None` for

///
/// Deliberately NOT purging: every timeout, dial/DNS/refusal failure, TLS
/// alert, protocol framing failure, and the statuses `429`/`412`/`500`/`503`.
/// Each is either indistinguishable from a transient network condition or a
/// rate-limit/bot-management answer from the CDN, and none of them is a
/// statement the origin made about this config (spec §7).
///
/// `fp` is the link's TLS fingerprint as the CONFIG carries it (never the
/// `security_fp` column — no call site holds a `Protocol` row, and the row
/// label reads the column from the page projection; spec §5.3 records the
/// split and the agreement test it owes). When it is an approximation, the
/// probe dialled a shape the link did not ask for, so the failure is about a
/// config that was never tried and earns NO verdict.
///
/// Not `const` any more: the approximation check goes through the SAME
/// predicate the capability gate and the row label use
/// (`security::fingerprint::resolve_fingerprint`), and that predicate is not
/// `const`. Re-implementing the check inline to keep `const` would duplicate
/// the single decision point this rule exists to share.
