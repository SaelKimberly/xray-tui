//! Native real-ping probe policy: one tunnel to the ping URL's host, one HTTP
//! request over it, then (on success) a second tunnel to fetch the exit IP.
//!
//! Transport, TLS and HTTP live in `xray_tui_native::probe`; this module owns
//! only the policy around it (URL shape, retry fan-out, the latency span, the
//! exit-IP parse and the error strings the event path persists).
//!
//! Latency span: proxy dial → protocol handshake → target TCP + TLS → request →
//! response head. That is the same span the subprocess probe covered minus the
//! loopback SOCKS hop, so persisted delays stay comparable across the cutover.
//!
//! The engine is responsible for DNS of the proxy server (once per attempt,
//! bounded by its own DIAL deadline) and the target hostname travels in the
//! protocol header, so the remote side resolves it — exactly as before.
