//! Generic write-behind drain driver shared by every write path.
//!
//! A [`WriteBehind<S>`] holds staged rows in a [`DashMap`], kept authoritative
//! while a batch runs, and turns them into chunked transactions on a background
//! task. It is the systematized form of `LinkWriter` (see
//! `docs/aegis/specs/2026-10-05-rowcache-write-behind-design.md`): the same
//! four-trigger policy and re-stage contract, with the per-table parts — the key,
//! the coalesce rule, the write and the rank refresh — supplied by a
//! [`CacheSpec`].
//!
//! Why this exists: concurrent single-row writers on one Turso/SQLite
//! connection produced `query failed [5000ms]` timeouts and `snapshot stale`
//! rollbacks during a 51,087-link import (2026-10-05). Batching the writes into
//! one transaction per window, off the caller's task, is the fix.
//!
//! The driver owns the transaction: [`WriteBehind::flush`] opens one
//! connection + transaction per chunk, calls [`CacheSpec::write_window`] then
//! [`CacheSpec::refresh`], and commits — all inside [`crate::retry_on_busy`].
//! Both spec hooks therefore take `&mut impl toasty::Executor` and never open a
//! transaction of their own.
