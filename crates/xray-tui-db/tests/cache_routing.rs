//! The leak this pins: the published driver ran EVERY statement through
//! `prepare_cached`, whose per-connection map is unbounded and keyed by SQL
//! text. The bulk writers inline their literals, so each window is a new text —
//! a compiled program retained for the connection's life (measured ~116-310 KiB
//! per distinct text; the page hydration grew RSS +123,580 KiB over 400 calls).
//!
//! The fork routes `Operation::RawSql` (hand-built, literal-inlined text — what
//! `toasty::sql::query`/`statement` produce) through the UNCACHED `prepare`, and
//! keeps `prepare_cached` only for engine-generated `Insert`/`QuerySql`. This
//! test drives the `RawSql` path with fresh text on ONE pooled connection and
//! asserts RSS does not scale with the call count.
