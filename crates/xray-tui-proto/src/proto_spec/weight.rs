//! The static config weight: a compiled prior for "which transport/security
//! stack is most likely to work today".
//!
//! This is a TASTE TABLE, not a measurement and not a cost model. It answers a
//! question measurement cannot yet answer: among links nothing has probed, which
//! stack should be tried first. Spec:
//! `docs/aegis/specs/2026-10-01-static-config-weight-design.md`.
//!
//! Three properties the rest of the feature depends on:
//!
//! * **Lexicographic, higher = better.** Declaration order IS precedence, so
//!   `security` decides unless two stacks tie on it exactly. That is why every
//!   area is authored as a COARSE BAND (0..=[`BAND_MAX`], 10): with finer values the
//!   lower three areas are read only on exact ties and the weight degenerates
//!   to "pick the best security". Coarse bands are a design constraint, not a
//!   convenience.
//! * **Exhaustive lookups.** [`security_score`], [`mimicry_score`] and
//!   [`transport_score`] are total `match`es with no `_` arm — on BOTH axes for
//!   the pair-valued [`mimicry_score`] — so a new [`TransportType`] /
//!   [`SecurityType`] variant is a COMPILE ERROR here rather than a silent zero
//!   that sinks every row of that shape to the bottom of the page. Same rule and
//!   same reason as `xray-tui-native`'s `capability::transport_supported`.
//! * **Versioned.** The tables are code, so any edit silently invalidates every
//!   stored weight. Bump [`WEIGHT_VERSION`] when a cell changes; the DB layer
//!   compares it at open and recomputes the materialized keys on a mismatch.
//!
//! ## Deliberate omissions
//!
//! * **Protocol kind is not a dimension.** VLESS/VMess/Trojan over the same
//!   transport+security score identically: what a deep probe can distinguish is
//!   measurement's job, not this table's.
//! * **No sub-config facts.** Nothing here reads ws `path`, xhttp `mode` or kcp
//!   `header_type`; those live in the deferred `config` JSON, and a weight that
//!   needed them would force a decode on the write path. The function takes
//!   only the discriminators the DB already stores in scalar columns.
