# Purge reasons: evidence-based permanent moves to Purgatory

Date: `2026-09-17`
Status: `design — awaiting user review`
Scope: `xray-tui-db`, `xray-tui`, `xray-tui-native`, `xray-tui-tls`
Related: `specs/2026-09-11-profiles-page-query-design.md` (the page query),
`specs/2026-09-14-profiles-stored-sort-key-design.md` + `adr/0003` (the ordering
keys), `specs/2026-09-11-write-behind-link-writer-design.md` + `adr/0002` (the
link writers), `adr/0004` (the native real-ping engine), `docs/database.md`,
`docs/database-manual-sql.md`, `AGENTS.md` decisions 4, 16, 20, 21, 22.

## 1. Problem

Purgatory today holds exactly one thing: rows whose newest link is older than
`purgatory.ttl_days` (7), reclaimed by `purge_expired` after
`retention_days` (30). That is a *staleness* test, and it is the only test.

But a real probe can produce evidence that a config can **never** work again —
a REALITY endpoint answering with a real certificate, a proxy whose own upgrade
handshake answers `404`, a CDN answering `530` because the origin is gone. That
evidence is discarded: the failure lands in `profile_stats.error` (a marker the
`error_ttl_hours` sweep deletes) and the row stays in the Active view forever,
competing for attention with configs that work. On the 2026-09-17 corpus, 1,687
links already carry such evidence, and phase 2 was only 27 % done.

The goal: **a link whose probe returned permanent evidence leaves the Active
view immediately and permanently** (until it is proven alive again, or the
retention window reclaims it). The tab then shows effective profiles, and the
"one endpoint, several protocols, only one real" case resolves itself after a
Real run.

## 2. Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | The unit of purge is the **link** (`(protocol_id, endpoint_id)`), not the endpoint | A purged sibling must not drag a working protocol out of the Active view. The user's case, verbatim: "wrong protocols will be naturally wiped" |
| D2 | Evidence set = **strict + server-answered handshake** (taxonomy in §7) | The strongest available signals; 429/412/5xx and TLS `alert 40` are plausibly transient CDN behaviour, so they are excluded |
| D3 | A purge is reversed by a **manual real test from the Purgatory view**; feed-wide sweeps skip purged links | Phase 2 is the long pole (2.6 results/s). A sweep must not spend it re-proving what it already knows; a user asking about one row must be able to re-prove it |
| D4 | The dead `AppConfig.purgatory.enabled` field is **deleted** | It has no reader and no settings-form row; the feature needs no toggle |
| D5 | The purge is a **typed enum in a new `profile_stats` column**, never a text prefix | The page predicate (SQL) and the ordering law (Rust) must read it; `docs/database-manual-sql.md` §1 forbids a second spelling of a stored fact, and the error marker is swept while the purge must outlive it |
| D6 | Evidence is **typed where it happens**, never parsed from the message text | The repo's standing rule (`ProbeClass` doc comment, `ping.rs`); the status code is available as a value at every site that produces it |
| D7 | `PurgatoryView::Stale` is **renamed `Purgatory`** and its predicate becomes "not confirmed live and recent" | The view now holds two populations (aged links, purged links) under one question, and the old name would be a lie |

## 3. Data model

```rust
// crates/xray-tui-db/src/models_toasty.rs

/// Why a link was moved to Purgatory permanently. Fieldless on purpose: the
/// exact case IS the variant, so the row needs ONE nullable column and one
/// CHECK list — the status code and the human detail stay in `error_text`.
#[derive(Debug, Clone, Copy, PartialEq, Eq, toasty::Embed)]
pub enum PurgeReason {
    /// A REALITY handshake was answered by a real certificate: wrong
    /// `pbk`/`sid`, or the host is not a REALITY endpoint at all.
    RealityFallback,
    /// The server's certificate does not cover the configured host/SNI.
    CertificateMismatch,
    /// The server's certificate is expired.
    CertificateExpired,
    /// The port answered in cleartext: it is not the TLS endpoint the config
    /// claims.
    NotTls,
    /// The config as stored cannot dial (missing `pbk`, malformed request
    /// authority/URI, unknown xhttp mode, unusable PSK).
    ConfigInvalid,
    /// The proxy's OWN upgrade handshake was answered with an HTTP status
    /// (400/403/404/405/409/410/3xx).
    TransportRejected,
    /// The CDN answered an origin error (530/521/522/526): the origin behind
    /// the fronting host is gone.
    OriginUnreachable,
}
```

On `ProfileStats`:

```rust
    /// Permanent-purge verdict from the last real probe. `None` = live.
    /// Distinct fact from `error` (which is a measurement marker the TTL sweep
    /// clears): this one is only cleared by a data-carrying success.
    pub purge_reason: Option<PurgeReason>,
```

- **Physical shape (verified by probe, 2026-09-17).** toasty's derive emits
  `Option<PurgeReason>` as exactly ONE nullable `TEXT` column — no separate
  flag column — with a `CHECK` list of the variants rendered in snake_case:

  ```sql
  "purge_reason" TEXT CHECK ("purge_reason" IN ('reality_fallback',
    'certificate_mismatch', 'certificate_expired', 'not_tls', 'config_invalid',
    'transport_rejected', 'origin_unreachable'))
  ```

  Probe: a throwaway `toasty::Model` with `reason: Option<ProbeReason>` pushed
  through `push_schema` emitted `"reason" TEXT CHECK ("reason" IN ('alpha',
  'beta_gamma'))`, `Some(BetaGamma)` stored `'beta_gamma'` and `None` stored
  `NULL` (the probe was removed after the run). The hand-written writers must
  spell the variants the same way (`purge_reason_str`, an exhaustive `const fn`
  mirroring `error_kind_str`); a wrong spelling is refused by the `CHECK`, and
  the statement-vs-schema test is what proves the spellings match.
- **Schema tag 11 → 12.** A column cannot be added to an already-pushed table
  here (decision 4), so this is a **wipe**, not a migration.

```text
Data Destruction Guard
- Target Class: persistent-state (the live SQLite file, `~/.config/xray-tui/data.db`)
- Exact Target(s): the `profile_stats` re-create; every endpoint, link, protocol,
  test result and traffic counter on the developer machine
- Environment: local developer database, schema tag 11 (27,142 endpoints /
  21,113 protocols / 56,140 links, re-importable from its subscriptions)
- Why Irreversible: `push_schema` emits CREATE TABLE without IF NOT EXISTS and
  `open` deletes the file on a tag mismatch (decision 4); there is no migration
  machinery and none is planned while the database is re-importable fixture data
- Backup / Rollback Note: the file is 32.8 MB and untouched until the new binary
  opens it; copy `data.db{,-wal,-shm}` before the first run to keep the corpus
- Allowed Read-Only Next Steps: write the spec and plan; read the corpus
- Blocked Destructive Steps: shipping the tag bump without the copy above, and
  re-running the corpus before deciding the taxonomy is final
- Confirmation Required: yes — the plan's first task takes it as a gate
- Status: confirmed by the user 2026-09-17 (bump to 12; corpus wipe accepted)
```

## 4. The ordering law (decision 16 amendment)

`endpoint_rank::RankLink` gains one input, and the law stays in ONE place
(`RankLink::key`, which `EndpointRow::link_test_key` delegates to):

```rust
pub struct RankLink { /* … */ pub purged: bool }
```

- `key()`: `purged` → **tier 6**, below every live tier (0 real-ok … 5 DNS).
  A purged link can therefore never be an endpoint's representative key or
  display link while a live link exists; when every link is purged, the min is
  tier 6 and the endpoint still has a deterministic position for the
  Purgatory/All views.
- `compute_rank`: `newest_seen` is the maximum `seen_secs` over **live** links,
  `NO_SEEN` (`i64::MIN`) when there are none. This is the single fact that makes
  §5's predicate work.
- `display_link_index`: **live links own the display while any exists**; an
  endpoint whose links are ALL purged falls back to its purged links, so a
  Purgatory row still shows the values it has (the spec's original "fallback"
  clause, made explicit). The gate covers the `manual_protocol_override` branch
  too — a pin must not resurrect a purged link as the representative while a
  live link exists (otherwise the Active view's Speed/Traffic/ConfigType/
  LastSeen sorts would read a purged link's columns). `display_rank()` itself is
  unchanged: the eligibility gate lives in the caller, not in the rank.
- `EndpointRow::select_best_measured_link`: the same gate, so an `All`-view
  row's headline delay never comes from a purged link unless the endpoint has no
  live link at all.

No new rank column and no new index: tier 6 rides `rank_tier`, and the
`rank_newest_seen` column keeps its `endpoint_rank_window` index. The covering
index `endpoint_rank_test` is unchanged.

## 5. Views

| View (`p` cycles Active → Purgatory → All) | Predicate | Links loaded into the page |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Active` | `k.rank_newest_seen >= :active` | live only |
| `Purgatory` | `k.rank_newest_seen < :active` | all |
| `All` | `1 = 1` | all |

- Purgatory is one range on the **existing** window index, and it needs no
  `OR`: a zero-live-link endpoint has `newest_seen = NO_SEEN < active`, so it
  lands there by construction, together with the aged band.
- `PageRequest.stale_threshold` and the `purgatory_retention_secs` page bound
  are **retired**. The lower bound would make an endpoint invisible in both
  views when its only live links are older than retention while a purged link
  was refreshed today — a state this feature creates deliberately. The
  10-minute retention sweep still owns deletion.
- Hydration: `load_page_projection` and `load_page_rows` (the typed reference the
  parity test pins it against) take `include_purged: bool` and append
  `AND ps.purge_reason IS NULL` when false. Active passes `false`; Purgatory and
  All pass `true`. The batch's `load_feed_plan` passes `false` (D3); the
  selected-endpoint plan reads the already-loaded page, so it keeps them —
  which is exactly the existing `PlanSource::Feed` vs `PlanSource::Links` split.
- `PurgatoryView::Stale` → `Purgatory`; the tab label reads
  `View: Purgatory [P]`.

## 6. Evidence plumbing (typed, never parsed)

| Layer | Today | Change |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xray-tui-tls/src/error.rs` | `Verify(String)`, `Handshake(String)` | add `CertNotValidForName(String)`, `CertExpired(String)`, `CleartextPeer(String)`; every `Display` keeps today's text |
| `xray-tui-tls/src/verify/mod.rs` | name mismatch (L154) and chain verify (L148) both `Verify` | L154 → `CertNotValidForName`; L148 matches `webpki::Error::{CertExpired, CertNotValidYet}` → `CertExpired` (and `CertNotValidForName` → its variant), else `Verify` |
| `xray-tui-tls/src/record/mod.rs` | cleartext diagnosis → `Handshake` | → `CleartextPeer`. (The `TlsStream::poll_read` twin in `record/stream.rs` stays an `io::Error` — an `AsyncRead` impl cannot return a `TlsError`, and the probe path reads the server flight through `read_record_into`, which is this site) |
| `xray-tui-native/src/error.rs` | `Tls(String)`, `Transport(String)` | add `CertNotValidForName(String)`, `CertExpired(String)`, `CleartextPeer(String)` and `TransportRejected { detail, status: u16 }`, plus `FailureEvidence` + `NativeError::evidence()` (ONE exhaustive match — the single owner of "what does this error prove"). `Display` text unchanged; the pre-existing doubled `TLS error: TLS error:` prefix is dropped (`map_tls_err` no longer pre-pends) |
| `xray-tui-native/src/security/mod.rs::map_tls_err` | flattens every `TlsError` to `Tls(String)` | forwards the three typed causes to their own variants; `RealityFallback` stays `Reality`; everything else stays `Tls` |
| `transport/ws.rs` (2 sites), `httpupgrade.rs`, `v2rayhttp.rs`, `xhttp.rs` (`send_200`) | status → `Transport(format!(…))` | → `TransportRejected { detail, status }` with the status from `resp.status()` / tungstenite's `Error::Http` |
| `xray-tui/src/ops/ping_native.rs` | `ProbeFailure { class, text }` | gains `evidence: Option<FailureEvidence>`, set only by `from_engine`. `local(…)` (probe-URL shape, unexpected status) and `ProbeOutcome::soft_failure(…)` carry `None` — **which is what keeps native-capability refusals out of the taxonomy** |
| `xray-tui/src/ops/ping.rs` | `ProbeOutcome::Failed { text, class, hard }` | gains `evidence` |
| `xray-tui/src/types.rs` `CoreEvent::SpeedTestResult` | `error: Option<String>` | gains `purge: Option<PurgeReason>` for the single-ping path |

**The proxy leg only — a guard, not a convention.** The probe has TWO TLS legs:
the proxy (the tunnel, through `security::wrap` → `map_tls_err`) and the probe's
own target (`gstatic`) inside `probe.rs::fetch_over`, which reports its failure
as `NativeError::Tls(e.to_string())` directly (not through `map_tls_err`). That
asymmetry is load-bearing: a target-certificate failure must never purge a
config, because it says nothing about the config. The typed variants are
therefore reachable ONLY from the proxy leg, and
`probe.rs` keeps plain `Tls` — pinned by a test asserting a target-TLS failure
yields `evidence() == None`. An implementer "unifying" the two mappings would
break that test.

The **policy** (evidence → reason) is one new TUI module,
`crates/xray-tui/src/ops/purge.rs`, with one function:

```rust
/// The single owner of "which probe evidence moves a config to Purgatory".
pub fn reason_for(evidence: FailureEvidence) -> Option<PurgeReason>
```

Product policy lives here (which statuses count), while engine truth stays in
`xray-tui-native`. A future taxonomy change touches this function.

## 7. Classification (D2)

| Evidence (typed) | Reason | Corpus 2026-09-17 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REALITY auth fallback — real certificate | `RealityFallback` | 234 |
| cert not valid for the configured name | `CertificateMismatch` | 110 |
| cert chain verification failed with expiry | `CertificateExpired` | 59 |
| peer answered cleartext | `NotTls` | 37 |
| `NativeError::Config` from the engine (missing `pbk`, unknown xhttp mode, unusable PSK, a request the stored host/path cannot compose) | `ConfigInvalid` | 27 |
| proxy's own handshake status ∈ {400, 403, 404, 405, 409, 410, 301, 302} | `TransportRejected` | ~1,000 |
| handshake status ∈ {530, 521, 522, 526} | `OriginUnreachable` | ~270 |

**Deliberately excluded** (no purge, marker only — unchanged behaviour):
TLS `alert 40`/`2 112`/`2 80` (1,285), statuses 429/412/500/503 (transient CDN /
rate-limit / bot-management, not config evidence), protocol framing failures
(vless header truncated, http2 error), every timeout (3,079), every fast-phase
failure (timeout / refused / no route / unreachable / DNS — 31,020), and
`not testable by the native engine` (198 — the subprocess core may serve them).

Measured on the 2026-09-17 corpus snapshot (held at
`/tmp/xray-tui-tag11-backup/`, with the per-link verdicts beside it in
`purge-classification.csv`): **739 links purged over 362 endpoints** —
`TransportRejected` 408, `RealityFallback` 163, `OriginUnreachable` 91,
`ConfigInvalid` 27, `NotTls` 24, `CertificateMismatch` 23,
`CertificateExpired` 3. The numbers move with every probe run (a later batch
overwrites an earlier run's markers: the same taxonomy read 1,687 links on the
pre-run state), so the table above is the *classification rule* and this
paragraph is one `SELECT` against one snapshot, not a target. T8 re-measures and
replaces these numbers.

The mechanism behind the `ConfigInvalid` row matters: a config whose stored
host/path cannot compose a request (`ws request: HTTP format error: invalid
authority`, `invalid uri character`) fails at the request-BUILD site, which
reports `NativeError::Transport` today. Those sites move to `Config` — the row
cannot dial as stored, which is exactly what `Config` means now — so they carry
`ConfigDefect`. Without that, 40-odd structurally broken configs would sit in the
Active view forever. The same honesty pass moved `now_unix_secs` from `Config`
to `Io`.

## 8. Write path and lifecycle

- **Purge gets its own `LinkGroups::PURGE` bit** (`0b010`; `ALL` becomes
  `0b111`) — the classifier is the only producer, and a fast result can neither
  set nor clear it. The alternative (riding RESULT) is a silent-clobber trap:
  `link_patch_conflict_sql` writes a FIXED column set from each patch's
  *snapshot*, so every RESULT patch — including a phase-1 fast half, whose
  snapshot is the plan-time row — would rewrite `purge_reason` from that
  snapshot. That is the exact shape ADR 0002's column groups exist to prevent,
  and today it is only *incidentally* safe (plan/page snapshots happen to be
  fresh). `apply_test_result` therefore says WHICH groups the outcome decides
  (`RESULT`, plus `PURGE` when the verdict changes), and the statement's
  `ON CONFLICT` action follows the group rather than the Rust-side intent:
  - `link_values_sql` carries the column in the VALUES tuple (every row needs
    it; a missing row is inserted with the snapshot's value);
  - `link_patch_conflict_sql` gains a third flag and writes
    `purge_reason = excluded.purge_reason` only in the PURGE-bearing shapes;
  - `LinkWriter::stage`/`merge_group`/`drain` treat PURGE like the other flags
    (one entry per `(link, group)`, coalesced by union);
  - `upsert_link` (the typed full-row writer) still round-trips it — it writes
    whole rows by contract;
  - `LINK_SOURCE_CONFLICT_SQL` (the import path) never writes it on update —
    same reasoning that keeps it off `latency`/`error`.
  Pinned by tests: a fast result on a purged link leaves the verdict intact; a
  RESULT-only patch cannot clear it; a PURGE patch can set and clear it.
- **Set**: a real probe that fails with `Some(reason)` → `purge_reason = reason`.
  **Cleared** (two owners, both explicit): a successful `RealPing` — a tunnel
  built from this link's own config — or a successful `SpeedTest` — a transfer
  carried by the connected tunnel. **Never touched** by `TcpPing`/`UdpTest`
  (a TCP handshake proves nothing about the config) and never by `Cancelled`.
- `clear_expired_errors` (the `error_ttl_hours` sweep) writes only the error
  columns, so a purge outlives a swept marker — the permanence the user asked
  for.
- **Retention is unchanged**: `purge_expired` still deletes endpoints whose
  newest link (purged or not) is older than the retention window. A subscription
  that keeps re-confirming a purged config keeps it alive in Purgatory; once
  upstream drops it, the window reclaims it. That is the user's "until lifetime
  exceeds (no upstream confirmation)".
- `remove_failed_servers` / `is_removable_failure` are **not** changed: purge is
  not a deletion verdict, and retention owns deletion.

## 9. Surfaces

- View label `View: Purgatory [P]`; the `p` cycle and the `r` (restore/test on
  Purgatory) key handler keep their shape.
- A purged sub-row's Test cell shows the reason label (short forms:
  `[mitm]`, `[cert]`, `[expired]`, `[tls]`, `[cfg]`, `[http]`, `[origin]`)
  instead of a delay or a failure marker — a *status*, exactly as the untestable
  marker already outranks a delay.
- The panel shows purged links only in Purgatory/All; the Active panel is the
  "effective profiles" list. An endpoint row with no live link never appears in
  Active at all.
- Exact label strings and column placement are implementation-owned; the
  precedence rule above is not.

## 10. Non-goals

- No purge from fast-phase failures, from gRPC/telemetry, or from a connect.
- No purge for `not testable by the native engine` (subprocess-only capability).
- No auto-revert on a subscription refresh (a re-published config is not proof).
- No purge clearing on connect (`update_last_used` stamps recency only): a connect
  emits no result event, so a data-carrying success is the only reversal signal
  the pipeline actually reports.
- No settings toggle, no settings-form surface, no new config field (D4 deletes
  one instead).
- No manual "purge this row" / "restore this row" action.
- No migration machinery, no `ensure_column`, no second schema-tag meaning.
- No change to `purge_expired`, to retention semantics, or to `Protocol` rows
  (an orphan protocol stays legal).

## 11. Acceptance criteria

1. A real probe whose failure carries evidence sets the link's `purge_reason` to
   that reason, and the value survives `error_ttl_hours` expiry and a restart.
2. An endpoint with zero live links is absent from Active and present in
   Purgatory; a partially purged endpoint stays in Active and its panel lists
   only its live links.
3. A successful real test launched from the Purgatory view clears the reason and
   the link returns to Active on the next page load.
4. A feed-wide batch plans zero purged links; a selected-endpoint real test on a
   purged link does probe it.
5. Stored ordering keys still match the Rust oracle for all 8 sorts × both
   directions with purged links in the fixture, and an endpoint whose best link
   was purged orders by its best live link.
6. `not testable by the native engine` never sets a purge reason, and never
   disappears from the Active view.
7. `rank_newest_seen` equals the live-only maximum: an endpoint whose only fresh
   link is purged appears in Purgatory only.
8. The statement-vs-schema test exercises the new column on every raw path that
   reads or writes it (`PAGE_PROJECTION`, the rank readers, the link writers).

## 12. Verification

- `every_statement_runs_against_a_pushed_schema` (`tests/profiles_query.rs`) —
  must cover the projection and each view.
- `page_order_matches_the_rust_oracle_for_every_sort` + the parity test
  `page_projection_matches_the_orm_rows` with a purged-link fixture.
- New unit tests: `reason_for` over every `FailureEvidence` (including the
  excluded statuses), `NativeError::evidence` over every variant, `RankLink::key`
  tier 6, `compute_rank`'s live-only `newest_seen`, the display-link fallback.
- Behaviour tests on the write path: `apply_link_patches` RESULT group carries the
  column; a TRAFFIC-only patch leaves it alone; `update_scheduler_state` never
  writes it; the import path never writes it; the TTL sweep never clears it.
- Smoke run against the real corpus after the wipe: import, batch, then read the
  Active/Purgatory counts and compare with §7's projection.

## 13. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| A `403` is Cloudflare bot-managing our TLS fingerprint, not a dead config | Excluded statuses cover the transient classes; the purge is reversible by one real test |
| The taxonomy turns out too aggressive or too timid | One function (`reason_for`), one column, no schema change to revise it |
| The tag bump destroys the corpus under study | Guard card in §3; copy the file before the first run |
| A purge on a link whose protocol row is shared with a live endpoint | Link-scoped by construction: `purge_reason` lives on the pair, `Protocol` rows are untouched |
| `All`-view rows looking odd (purged link with a delay) | The display-link rules in §4 keep the row's headline numbers on a live link |

## 14. Impact statement and ADR signal

```text
ImpactStatementDraft
- Layers: db schema + raw SQL writers (db), probe policy + event handlers (tui),
  error types (native, tls), UI view semantics (tui/ui)
- Owners: profile_stats (new fact), endpoint_rank (new input), profiles_query
  (predicate + projection), ops/purge.rs (new, the taxonomy's single owner)
- Invariants: decision 16 law has one implementation; SQL never re-derives it;
  one column group per writer; no text parsing of failures
- Compatibility: schema tag 11 → 12 = wipe (decision 4); no migration
- Retired: AppConfig.purgatory.enabled, PurgatoryView::Stale, PageRequest.stale_threshold
- Non-goals: see §10
- ADR signal: yes — ADR 0006 "Purge evidence is persisted per link; Purgatory is
  'not confirmed live and recent'" (owner: db + tui). Durable surfaces: a new
  source-of-truth fact, the view predicate, the ordering law's new input, three
  retirements. Status: proposed, to be written when the plan lands.
```


## Amendment — 2026-09-22: two mapping refinements and the approximated rule

Spec: `2026-09-22-native-testability-improvement-design.md` (T5). **No new `PurgeReason`
variant, no CHECK change, no schema bump, no wipe** — every change is inside
`reason_for(FailureEvidence)`, the one function that decides verdicts.

1. **A config defect is not a peer verdict.** Four sites created a malformed REALITY config
   (`missing pbk`, non-base64 `pbk`, `pbk` not 32 bytes, malformed `short_id`) as
   `NativeError::Reality`, and `NativeError::evidence()` maps that variant to
   `FailureEvidence::RealityFallback` — so a broken config was purged as *"the server is not
   REALITY / a possible MITM"*, a verdict about a peer that was never reached (21 rows on the
   live feed). They now raise `NativeError::Config` → `ConfigDefect` → `config_invalid`.
   `FailureEvidence::ConfigDefect => PurgeReason::ConfigInvalid` already existed, so this half
   needed no change here at all — the defect was upstream, where the error was created.

2. **An approximated probe earns no verdict.** `reason_for` gains an `fp` parameter and returns
   `None` when that fingerprint is an approximation, decided by the SAME predicate the capability
   gate and the row label use (`security::fingerprint::resolve_fingerprint`). The input is the
   CONFIG's `fp`, not the `security_fp` column: no `reason_for` call site holds a `Protocol` row.
   The row label reads the column, so the two-accessor agreement is asserted
   (`the_security_fp_column_agrees_with_the_config_field` in `state.rs`) rather than assumed.
   A lookup miss fails **closed** — no verdict — because failing open would let an approximated
   probe earn exactly the permanent verdict the rule exists to prevent.

`reason_for` is no longer `const`: the check goes through a non-`const` predicate, and
re-implementing it inline would duplicate the single decision point.
